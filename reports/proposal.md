# Cuda Renderer Proposal
Mateos Norian, Krishna Suresh, Merwan Yeditha

###Experience with Last Project

**Krishna:** Overall the last project was enjoyable. I had a great experience in applying some of the theoretical concepts from signal processing and also got exposure to common compression techniques. I do hope to implement a more niche final result rather than purely reimplementing an existing algorithm.

**Mateos:** My experience with the last project was pretty brutal. I struggled balancing the project work with class homework, which resulted in an unfinished project. I think this partially stemmed from not having teammates for accountability and motivation, but also poor time management on my part. I think in this project, working with teammates will certainly be helpful, but also planning my weeks out and allocating time for project work in advance is a requirement.

**Merwan**: I enjoyed working on the last project and the opportunity to work with C in a larger-scale program. For this project, I want to approach the assignment similarly to last project, but in a less scaffolded project where I can learn a bit more.

### Goal
We want to code a raytracing engine/3D renderer using Cuda and C using WebAssembly so that the app can be run through a browser while using local resources. Our MVP would be to be able to raytrace for a fixed frame. A more stretch goal would be to somehow customize the scene that we are rendering (being able to place different types of objects, change position of light, add more light sources). 

### Learning Goals
* Understanding Cuda
* Gaining exposure to basic 3D graphics/rendering
* Programming using GPU resources
* Understanding how WebAssembly works

### Resources and Next Step
We've found a lot of resources on getting started with Cuda and how the math behind raytracing wroks. In terms of first steps, we want to go through tutorials on basic Cuda functions, then generate an image of a scene, and finally start to apply shadow/lighting effects on it. After these first steps, we'll investigate using WebAssembly and more advanced lighting.
